OS Assignment-3 Writeup

Working of SYSCALL:
SYSCALL_DEFINE2(rtnice,int, pid,long, time)
it takes two argument pid of type int and time of type long(in sec)
In my assignment the syscall no is 440
and it will return 0 on sucessfull working otherwise return negative value depending on the error.
In my syscall it will takes the value of time(in sec) and changes the rtnice value of the given PID task attributes

CFS Working:
In my implementation the process with greater(non-zero) rtnice value and lesser vruntime will prefer by the scheduler.
I added a new attribute of type u64 in sched_entity structure
changes made in the file:
In sched.h I added new attribute rtnice.
In core.c I initialize the rtnice value when task is created
and In fair.c I changed the defination of function such that it will work with new rtnice value.

Error Handled:
if PID is negative or greater than 32768 ,then it will not process further
if negative value is given to the time ,then it will not process further
