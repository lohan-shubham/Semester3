In my program I'm having a function named process which having a string parameter passed through it.
This string parameter is used to tell the fucntion that for which section we have to calculate the average marks of the students.

used syscall:
	I'm using write system call to print the required data into the console.

error handled:
mainly two type of error is handled by my program
1) as i used fopen to open csv file , which return null when openning a file caused any error.
so if like file is not present or cruptted then my program throw error showing that "File cant be opened".

2) I used fork() syscall to create child process it return 0 for child process and a no greater than 0 for parent process && negative value when there is an error while creating the process.
so whenever my program failed to create process it throw error
that  "Process cant be created".
